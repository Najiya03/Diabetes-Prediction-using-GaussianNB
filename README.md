# Diabetes-Prediction-using-GaussianNB

##  Project Overview
This project aims to **predict whether a person has diabetes** based on medical and lifestyle features using **Gaussian Naive Bayes Classifier**.  

The project covers the full ML pipeline:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature analysis
- Model training
- Model evaluation and prediction

---

##  Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**

---

##  Dataset Source
This project uses a publicly available dataset from **Kaggle**:

- **Dataset Name:** Diabetes Prediction Dataset  
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Dataset Link:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset  

The dataset contains medical and demographic features such as:
- Age
- Gender
- BMI
- Hypertension
- Heart disease
- Smoking history
- Blood glucose level

The target variable indicates whether the patient has **diabetes or not**.

> The dataset is used strictly for educational and research purposes.

##  Workflow
1. Import required libraries  
2. Load and explore the dataset  
3. Handle missing values and encode categorical features  
4. Perform feature scaling (if required)  
5. Split data into training and testing sets  
6. Train Gaussian Naive Bayes model  
7. Evaluate model performance  
8. Predict diabetes outcomes for new inputs

##  Model Evaluation
The models are evaluated using:
- **Accuracy Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**
- **Classification Report** (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
